This project is my playgroud for experimenting with CML and DVC.
As a meaning of automating some process in a typical machine learning
project.

Most of what i would be doing here can be found on the online tutorial on
MLOps.
But i thought i give it a try. 

## Getting Setup
Activate the python virtual environment

`source venv/bin/activate` for a linux system

`venv\Scripts\activate` for windows system

Install the required modules to the virtual environment
`pip install -r requirement.txt`
